Python interface to Bluetooth LE on Linux

This is a project to provide an API to allow access to Bluetooth Low Energy devices
from Python. At present it runs on Linux only; I've mostly developed it using a
Raspberry Pi, but it will also run on x86 Debian Linux.

There is also code which uses this to talk to a TI SensorTag  and Ti SensorTag 2 (www.ti.com/sensortag).

Installation
------------

The code needs an executable 'bluepy-helper' to be compiled from C source. Currently the Makefile is configured to build for ARM Linux; you will need to set the ARCH variable in it  appropriately for other platforms. The sources need glib and dbus headers to compile.

There are general instructions for setting up BlueZ on the Raspberry Pi at http://www.elinux.org/RPi_Bluetooth_LE.

To build on the Pi:

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential libglib2.0-dev libdbus-1-dev
    $ git clone https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy.git
    $ cd bluepy
    $ make

Once 'bluepy-helper' is built, you can copy it and the two .py files to somewhere
convenient on your Python path (e.g. /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/).

Documentation
-------------

Documentation can be built from the sources in the docs/ directory using Sphinx.

An online version of this is currently available at: http://ianharvey.github.io/bluepy-doc/

License
-------

This project uses code from the bluez project, which is available under the Version 2
of the GNU Public License.

The Python files are released into the public domain by their author, Ian Harvey.
