Python interface to Bluetooth LE on Linux

This is a project to provide an API to allow access to Bluetooth Low Energy devices
from Python. At present it runs on Linux only; I've mostly developed it using a
Raspberry Pi, but it will also run on x86 Debian Linux.

The code is tested on Python 2.7 and 3.4; it should also work on 3.3.

There is also code which uses this to talk to a TI SensorTag (www.ti.com/sensortag).

An example to interface the Nordic Semiconductor ASA IoT Sensor Kit, Thingy:52 is available 
in thingy52.py (https://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/Nordic-Thingy-52).

Installation
------------

The code needs an executable `bluepy-helper` to be compiled from C source. This is done
automatically if you use the recommended pip installation method (see below). Otherwise,
you can rebuild it using the Makefile in the `bluepy` directory.

To install the current released version, on most Debian-based systems:

    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip libglib2.0-dev
    $ sudo pip install bluepy


For Python 3, you may need to use `pip3`:

    $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip libglib2.0-dev
    $ sudo pip3 install bluepy

*If this fails* you should install from source.

    $ sudo apt-get install git build-essential libglib2.0-dev
    $ git clone https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy.git
    $ cd bluepy
    $ python setup.py build
    $ sudo python setup.py install

I would recommend having command-line tools from BlueZ available for debugging. There
are instructions for building BlueZ on the Raspberry Pi at http://www.elinux.org/RPi_Bluetooth_LE.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation can be built from the sources in the docs/ directory using Sphinx.

An online version of this is currently available at: http://ianharvey.github.io/bluepy-doc/

This project uses code from the bluez project, which is available under the Version 2

The Python files are released into the public domain by their author, Ian Harvey.
