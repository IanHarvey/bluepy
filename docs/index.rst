``bluepy`` - a Bluetooth LE interface for Python
================================================

``bluepy`` is a Python module which allows communication with Bluetooth Low
Energy devices. The current implementation runs on Linux
(internally it uses code from the `BlueZ project <http://www.bluez.org/>`_), although it can be ported to other
platforms.

To browse the API documentation, it is recommended to start with :ref:`peripheral`.
